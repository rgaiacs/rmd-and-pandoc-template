The car dataset gives the speed of cars and the distances taken to stop. **Note that the data were recorded in the 1920s.**

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(summary(cars))
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(cars, xlab = "Speed (mph)", ylab = "Stopping distance (ft)",
     las = 1)
lines(lowess(cars$speed, cars$dist, f = 2/3, iter = 3), col = "red")
title(main = "cars data")
```

But you should also try the logarithmic scles.

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(cars, xlab = "Speed (mph)", ylab = "Stopping distance (ft)",
     las = 1, log = "xy")
title(main = "cars data (logarithmic scales)")
```

\begin{abstract}
Three dimensional images were obtained using a single high numerical aperture hologram recorded in a high resolution photoresist with a table top alpha = 46.9 nm laser. Gabor holograms numerically reconstructed over a range of image planes by sweeping the propagation distance allow numerical optical sectioning that results in a robust three dimension image of a test object with a resolution in depth of approximately and a lateral resolution of 164 nm.
